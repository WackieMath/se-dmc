            <h1>Early Infant Treatment </h1>
            <p>The EIT study is a prospective clinical trial that enrolled infants from two major
              maternity hospitals in the Francistown and Gaborone regions of Botswana. Infants enrolled in
              the study began ART (Antiretroviral Therapy)
              in the first days (frequently, within hours) immediately following their births. The team
              compared their results to those of infants not in the study who received ART later (within
              a median of four months after birth). Infants were then followed for two years with blood
              sampling at regular intervals.
              <br/><br/>
              Investigators focused on 10 infants enrolled in the EIT study who were HIV positive at birth.
              They measured the number of virally infected cells (typically called viral reservoir cells)
              and many different types of innate and adaptive immune responses. The team observed that the
              number of reservoir cells was extremely small (significantly smaller than in adults who were
              on ART for a median of 16 years). The number of reservoir cells was also significantly smaller
              than in infected infants who started treatment later. The team also identified specific types of
              innate immune cells (NK cells and monocytes) that were on the rise while the viral reservoir size
              shrank, suggesting that these cells may influence or modulate viral reservoir cells.</p><br/><br/>

              •To enroll participants.<br/>
              •requisitioning of lab tests, printing sample labels, packing samples.<br/>
              •viewing results.<br/>
              •Ensure that the information on results is correct, which includes participant basic demographic information, specimen drawn dates and test panel.<br/>
              •Send queries to the lab for any results that need correction. <a href="http://eit.bhp.org.bw/" target="_blank">see EIT page</a>
